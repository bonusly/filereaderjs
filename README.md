# Filereaderjs

A gem wrapper for filereader.js (https://github.com/bgrins/filereader.js)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'filereaderjs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install filereaderjs

## Usage

Add `//= require filereader` to `application.js`

## Publishing

This is a public repo, so we don't need to publish the gem in order to pull the changes into an application. Add this line to your Gemfile to get this gem: `gem "filereaderjs", github: "bonusly/filereaderjs"`

When you have changes that you want to pull into an app (i.e. something you would publish as a new version), you can just run `bundle update filereaderjs` in the repo.

## Contributing
